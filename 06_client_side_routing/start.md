# Client Side Routing

### SWBATs:

- [ ] Explain client side routing
- [ ] Explain what a nested route is
- [ ] Observe how to handle nested client-side routes

Client side routing, is a technicque used in single page applications where the routing or navigation within a web application is handled by the browser on the client side. For example, when you are on google and do a search, you'll notice that the url changes as the user navigates the page. This is similar to server side routing, where each url change results in a full page reload from the server. The benefits of client side routing is improved user expereince, and performance.

## Deliverables

- In the `App` component import `createBrowserRouter`, `createRoutesFromElements`, `Route`, `RouterProvider` from the `react-router-dom` library

#### 2.  Use createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, Route, and RouterProvider to conditionally render compoments based on the url

- Demonstrate creating routes and testing in the browser, discuss using `path` and `element` in the route component

#### 3. Add navigation to the application using the `Link` and `NavLink` components

- Demonstrate creating `Link` and `NavLink` in the NavLayout Component

#### 4. Nested Routes
 - Demonstrate creating nested Routes

#### 5. Loaders


#### 6. Route Parameters


#### 7. Use Navigation

#### 8. React Alternatives
